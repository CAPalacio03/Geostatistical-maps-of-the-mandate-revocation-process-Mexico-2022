# Geostatistical-maps-of-the-mandate-revocation-process-Mexico-2022
Work that shows the creation of geostatistical maps of the mandate revocation process that took place in Mexico

When President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador assumed the presidency in 2018, he proposed that halfway through his term he would hold a process for the citizens to participate and decide if he was fit to continue in office or resign due to lack of capacity to govern. So, in 2020, Mexico carried out its first revocation process carried out by the National Electoral Institute (INE), the autonomous institution that carries out all the electoral processes at the national level.

In this process, 7% of the citizens participated in this process, but:
- Which was the State with the greatest citizen participation?
- Do Mexicans agree that the president continue with his mandate?

These and other answers are answered with the visualization of the data in geostatistical maps.
